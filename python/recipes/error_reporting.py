There are a few ways to report errors from a Python program. If you are writing your own exception
classes, you can handle reporting in their `__init__` methods as follows:
"""


class Boom(Exception):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        reporter.error_report(self)


"""
You can also handle all uncaught exceptions using the sys.excepthook
"""
